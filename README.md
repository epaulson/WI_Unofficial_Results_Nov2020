# Wisconsin Unofficial Election Results Collection, Nov 2020

[OpenElections](openelections.net) is collecting unofficial election night results for some swing states, Wisconsin included. 

As a first step, here's all 72 Wisconsin counties and where I think they'll post election results on November 3rd. The first column ("Results Site") is the webpage that I think will link to the results, the second column is where the actual results may be located. As this is being created before the election that column is blank for many counties, but some counties have put out placeholder documents for the results, which is what I've linked to in the 'Direct Results Column'. However, I expect that many counties will change the link as Tuesday night goes on (i.e. they'll change it from "election_results.pdf" to "election_results_v2.pdf" and so on) so the first "Results Site" column is more stable and useful long-term, though almost always won't be the directly downloadable datafiles.

## Data Management
There is a set of directories for each county that I imagined results could be saved into. Each county is going to give you something different for 'precinct level' results - most of them will be a single PDF of an Excel file or a PDF of a text report, but in a few cases you'll get an actual Excel or in the case of Dane County you can get an XML file. It won't always be one file - some counties break up their results into different categories (ie a file for Federal and then a file for State/Local, or worse a file per race) so I made a directory in which to save all of the results. (For the table above, if there's a link in the 'Direct Results' column and I had to make a choice, it goes to whatever file has the Presidential results)

There is an 'old' directory in each county, which is where I thought previous results data could be saved. I figured each time the data was updated there'd be a new directory created under `old/`, like `old/nov4_11am/` and then `old/nov4_7pm` and so on, and that's where the previous data would be `git mv`'d into. We can do whatever the OpenElex team wants to do, though.

We could also skip GitHub for storing result files and just use Google Drive or Dropbox or something.

### County notes
* Manitowc County doesn't seem to have "Reporting Unit" level results available, it might just be a countywide summary
* Memonomiee County might not post results at all (it's the smallest WI county, only 4000-some people)
* Portage County website was down so TBD
* Sauk's main interface is a ESRI web map, but there is a PDF in a link in the map, so that's what I used in the 'Direct results data' column
* Trempealeau's web interface is a dropdown closed by default, so you have to click on it to see results
* Waushara is going to post results on their main county page (and Facebook for good measure) and not their clerk page
* Wood County is an ASP site and is probably scriptable but I didn't mess with it for now because I didn't want to put a bunch of error messages in their weblogs.

### Other notes
To regenerate the table, save the WI_Unofficial_Results_Directory Excel as a Tab-separated file and then convert it to Markdown with https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-markdown.htm

Wisconsin uses 'reporting units' rather than precincts as its base unit for results data (it's a long story.) The Wisconsin Election Commission sometimes publishes the list of reporting units in use for an election but they didn't seem to do so for the 2020 Fall General. Instead, I downloaded the Polling Place list, which includes a column for each 'reporting unit', it's the Excel in the repo. I downloaded it on November 1st 2020 from https://elections.wi.gov/node/6976
